   * , i.e., the folder, where the images are located, or a full path for the
   * single label file.  If the path_prefix is a directory, then for each
   * path_suffix, they construct a full path to an input file (e.g., an image)
   * Besides, it also has shape/size info about the expected input data, e.g.,
   * the width and height of rgb image, based on which the reader may resize
   * the input image.
   * @param path_suffix, each suffix can be a full path or the last part of a
   * full path. For the imagenet dataset, the label source is in a single file,
   * hence the path_prefix is the full label file path, path_suffix is empty.
   * The format of each line of the label file is like: <image_filename,
   * labelid>. The feature source is a directory of images, hence the
   * path_prefix is the image directory, and the path_suffix is the
   * image_filename from the label source file.

   * file; otherwise the offset to the first file in t he file list (e.g., the
