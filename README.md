Please follow the google's c plus plus coding style, including the naming,
header files, formatting, comments, etc.
http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml

The cpplint.py can help to detect lines that do not follow the style.

External libraries include gflag (commandline parsing), glog (logging),
google-protobuf (configuration).

C++11 features are used.
